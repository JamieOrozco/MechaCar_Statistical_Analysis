# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar. It is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.The following was conducted:

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings

## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Below is a linear model that predicts the MPG of the prototypes using the data set provided from MechaCar_mpg file.

* The T-test for the suspension coils across all manufacturing lots shows that they are not statistically different from the population mean, and the p-value is not low enough (0.06028) for us to reject the null hypothesis.
* Sample 1 shows it's not statistically different from the population mean, and the p-value is not low enough (1) for us to reject the null hypothesis.
* Sample 2 shows it's not statistically different from the population mean, and the p-value is not low enough (0.6072) for us to reject the null hypothesis.
* Sample 3 shows it's slightly statistically different from the population mean, and the p-value is just low enough (0.04168) for us to REJECT the NULL hypothesis.
